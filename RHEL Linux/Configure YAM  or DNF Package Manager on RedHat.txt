** How to configure YUM or DNF Package Manager on RedHat Server?
-> Copy all the RedHat ISO File data into RedHat Server
	# lsblk
	# mkdir IsoFile
	# mount <IsoFile> /IsoFile
	# cd /IsoFile
	# mkdir /RedHat-9.1 
	# cp -rf * /RedHat-9.1
	
-> Create a Repo File inside the /etc/yum.repos.d and configure that repo file
	# vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.repo

[path-1]
name=This is my Local Repo-1 created by Debabrata.
baseurl=file:///RedHat-9.1/BaseOS
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[path-2]
name=This is my Local Repo-2 created by Debabrata.
baseurl=file:///RedHat-9.1/AppStream
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

	# yum clean all
		or =
	# dnf clean all	
** What will be the yum or dnf baseurl on redhat?
=> Appstream and BaseOS
=> In inside those both file - Packages and repodata directory should be there.
